### Description
This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Credits
I extend my gratitude to Udacity and to the tutors as thanks to them this project was successful. Thanks to the Bertelsman scholarship I could acquire new skills like writing queries in SQL, learned the basics of Python and related pandas library and finally was able to learn about version control in a GIT environment.
