### Credits
I extend my gratitude to Udacity and to the tutors as thanks to them this project was successful. Thanks to the Bertelsman scholarship I could acquire new skills like writing queries in SQL, learned the basics of Python and related pandas library and finally was able to learn about version control in a GIT environment.
